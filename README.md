# SPACE-INCURSION

This is the very first game I create.

I made it using pygame.

Just like in the game SPACE INVADERS, you control a spaceship and all you have to do is shoot the aliens moving towards you.

Only difference is that, here you can move along both the X and Y axes.

To run the game, download the ZIP file, decompress it.

Open the main folder, then double-click on the executable file named "Space Incursion" (Space Incursion.exe)

To those who may want to know, the background music is "Kodama(Interlude)" by Nujabes.

I'm a beginner so the game isn't really complete but still, have fun!
